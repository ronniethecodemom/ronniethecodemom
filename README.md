- 👋 Hi, I’m Verônica! But you can also call me Ronnie! 
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming Languages (Python & SQL) and Data Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Programming Logic to have a solid foundation when I start studying Python on my Data Science's classes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on study cases so that other IT students who are beginners in development can learn something or just inspire themselves to practice coding.
- 😄 Pronouns: She / Her
- 👀 Curious fact: I'm 30 years old, and I am the mom of an incredible little boy! I've been trying to find a profession that makes sense with who I am for years, and this year (2024) I finally found something that makes my eyes shine! I have fallen in love with this big IT universe, and it has got me so excited!
